# automated_web_bot
This is a game bot that requires an encrypted license key. 
 If you dont have a license or your old one expired, contact me: Padua#6834 on Discord

You need python, selenium, chrome webdriver installed and also do a "pip install licenses" and "pip install selenium" on terminal.

If you minimize the Bot window then you will be pausing the game collectors, 
you can choose whether you want constant collectors you can have it by not minimizing the selenium chrome tab
or minimize if you wish to stop it.

If you have any issues with the bot, contact me on telegram or discord!

PS: I removed the game url from the script files above(for obvious reasons), also removed a few things related to the encrypted key itself, such as product id, rsakey and token authentication, if you wish to know more about this eDomination bot, contact me.
